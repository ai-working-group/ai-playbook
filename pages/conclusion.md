The interest in artificial intelligence continues to gain momentum. Even though AI has been around for over a half a century, since its inception in 1956 at Dartmouth College by John McCarthy , its potential is just now being actualized. It has the potential to impact every aspect of our government operations and, if properly applied, will undoubtedly be a big part of shaping our future.

As organizations begin to appreciate the distinctions between AI and tools, they will be able to better understand its unique ability to consistently compare and correlate facts into analytical information upon which to contextualize the distinctions, differences, and differentials of a multitude of available options and the opportunities they offer. It is the resulting contextual understanding between items and time which is at the core of AI capabilities.

This playbook outlines the process of considering the viability of this technology to solve problems and serve the organization. It provides the pathway to apply AI to collect, correlate, and contextualize information that will enlighten, empower and evolve contextual understanding. AI offers the ability to explore the art of the possible and apply the science of the probable which informs what influence are available (causality) and how they affect our environment (consequence).

The progression and process of building knowledge based on understanding provides the potential to make better evidence-based decisions.  By using the frameworks, models, and steps presented in this Playbook, organizations will be well prepared to develop, implement, and integrate AI capabilities to optimize the effectiveness of their organization. Applying the definitions and types of AI found in the ACT-IAT Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Primer and the process described in this Playbook, the reader will be able to create AI solutions that serve their organization.

These resources prepare the organization for success in their efforts to leverage the capabilities of AI.  They illustrate the benefits of applying cognition to leverage knowledge and becoming aware of the options available to drive strategic advantage. The result is the intuitive capacity of the machine to become aware, adapt, and learn to make wise choices. This agile approach assures that past actions compared to current circumstances are made discernible in order to achieve the ascribed future objectives. The resulting iterative approach to integrating and implementing lessons learned enables AI to serve as a transformational catalyst to make the vision of the future a reality today.
